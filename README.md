Enter the required bed thickness in the em_thickness list
Enter the required lithologies and fluids in em_lith_list and em_fluid_list
  *Note that the lengths of all lists must be equal **No Error Checking is included yet

At present only Synthetic curves for Gamma Ray, Bulk Density and Sonic Compressional are created.
